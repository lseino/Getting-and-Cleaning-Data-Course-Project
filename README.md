## Introduction
 The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability 
to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The data used is owned by the following;
 Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. 
Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones using a Multiclass Hardware-Friendly Support Vector
 Machine. International Workshop of Ambient Assisted Living (IWAAL 2012). 
Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. Dec 2012

## Course Project
-Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
-Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
-Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
-Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
-From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each
 variable for each activity and each subject.

## About the Script
i created the script called run_analysis.R with takes in this input of txt files and does 
what the course project above demands on the UCI HAR DATASET.

## The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
-'subject_test/train.txt'

## CodeBook
The CodeBook.md file contains the variables used in my program and more details
